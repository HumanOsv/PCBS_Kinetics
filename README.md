# pCBS Kinetics


  The kinetic scheme that describes the binding of a substrate to an enzyme, and from which the Michaelis-Menten mechanism is obtained, is a simplification of the real process at molecular scale. This model considers that substrate binding occurs in one elementary step, whereas this process could involve several previous stages. The substrate can pass from within the solution to regions on the surface of the enzyme and then by different pathways reach the catalytic site. Due to experimental difficulties and the absence of a mathematical expression of the complete process, the impact of the presence of pre-catalytic binding sites (PCBS) on enzyme activity is unknown. To address this issue, a Michaelis-Menten-type expression was obtained for a number i of PCBSs under steady-state conditions. In this model, which describes a rectangular hyperbole of the same type as in the absence of PCBS, the kinetic parameters KM and Vmax adopt a complex expression that depends on the number of PCBS and the kinetic constants. 
  
  In order to perform all PCBS measurements, different Jupyter Notebooks from 0 to 5 sites were used. In the Jupyter Notebook, you can also add images, links, lists and other formatting elements using Markdown syntax. For more information on how to use Markdown in Jupyter Notebook, see the official documentation and other online resources. Remember that a Jupyter Notebook allows you to combine text, images and executable code into a single document, making it easy to document your workflows and analysis.
